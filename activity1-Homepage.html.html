       <h1 id="Sports_And_Recreation">Sports And Recreation</h1>
       <p>Both traditional and modern sports are popular in Saudi Arabia. The people of the Arabian Peninsula have enjoyed sports for thousands of years, including horse and camel racing, falconry and hunting with hounds. Today, modern sports are also popular – especially soccer.</p>
       <p>A special effort has been made to encourage sports and make them accessible to the public. Hundreds of facilities have been established throughout the Kingdom so that all Saudis can exercise regularly or enjoy popular spectator sports.</p>
       <p>In addition, all levels of the Saudi educational system – from kindergarten through university – emphasize the importance of sports.</p>
       <h1 id="Modern_sports">Modern sports</h1>
       <p>Soccer is by far the most popular modern sport in Saudi Arabia. Saudis of all ages have taken the game to heart, from children scrimmaging on playgrounds to international matches battled out in spectacular modern stadiums.</p>
       <p>There is a professional Saudi soccer league that is wildly popular among Saudis – friends and families often gather to cheer on their favorite teams, both on television and in stadiums. The highlight of the Saudi soccer league is its championship tournament known as the King’s Cup. Fans also avidly follow the Saudi Arabian national soccer team in World Cup competition.</p>
       <p>In addition to soccer, other organized sports have gained a following among Saudis, including volleyball, gymnastics, swimming and basketball.</p>
       <p>Saudi Arabia has a number of first-class golf courses. American expatriates introduced golf to Saudi Arabia in the late 1940s when they created a course in the sand near Dhahran. They mixed oil with the sand to keep the course from blowing away, a method that is still used in the Kingdom. Today, there are lush, green courses in that look like they belong in the tropics.</p>
       <h1 id="Sports_facilities">Sports facilities</h1>
       <p>The Kingdom has a number of different types of sports facilities, ranging from major sports complexes to neighborhood facilities and clubs.</p>
       <img src="image/p3.jpg" alt="Sports facilitie" class="center">
       <p>The huge sports complexes, called Sports Cities, are located in large population centers. Each complex has a stadium that can seat between 10,000 and 60,000 people, an indoor stadium seating 5,000, Olympic-size swimming pools, indoor and outdoor courts, playgrounds, conference halls, and sports medicine clinics.</p>
       <p>Smaller than the Sports Cities, neighborhood sports facilities and playgrounds were built in large urban areas so that young Saudis can play sports like basketball and volleyball near their homes. These centers offer parks, open spaces, and facilities for indoor activities.</p>
       <p>Local sports clubs are located in all cities and towns. They offer a range of facilities for different sports, including soccer fields, indoor and outdoor courts, swimming pools, playgrounds, recreational areas and accommodations for youth camps. These clubs organize local events throughout the year.</p>
       <h1 id="International_Competition">International Competition</h1>
       <p>Saudi Arabia's extensive sports program has brought about not only a quantitative growth of sports, but also a dramatic qualitative improvement. The performance of Saudi athletes has improved steadily since the Kingdom joined the International Olympic Committee in 1965.</p>
       <p>Since the early 1980s, Saudi athletes have proudly represented the Kingdom in an increasing number of regional and international competitions. The Saudi soccer team qualified for its first appearance in 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.</p>
       <p>In 1989, Saudi Arabia hosted the fifth World Youth Soccer Cup Championship, won the championship, and received a special commendation from FIFA, the international soccer federation, for the outstanding manner in which it has organized the event.</p>
       <p>In 1994, the Saudi national soccer team represented Asia at the World Cup finals in the United States, reached the second round, and received accolades for their playing. Saudi Arabia continues to participate in the World Cup every four years.</p>
       <p>The Kingdom also participated in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, with competitors in the equestrian, wrestling, and track and field events as well as in soccer.</p>
